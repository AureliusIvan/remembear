## Introduction 📖

Remembear is an app that helps you to remember things in short term memory. It's a simple app that can be used in daily
life to remember things like shopping list, to-do list, or any other things that you want to remember in short term.

> [!NOTE]
> The Remembear repository now also depends on the Mem0AI project. We continue to maintain and support Mem0AI ❤️. You
> can find the Mem0AI repository in the [Mem0AI](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0).
